Introduction:
The purpose of the lab is to define words.  Additionally, answer the questions given after the lab and screenshot and document.

Process:
The simplicity of the lab makes it fun to work with Git and Github. However, there have been some challenges because I am new to Git and Github so I am getting used to it.

Definitions:
Push- to send committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com
Pull- fetching in changes and merging them
Commit- another word for revision, is an individual change to a file (or set of files)
Fork- personal copy of another users repository that lives on your account
Clone- a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy

Conclusion:
The goals of the lab is to introduce us into programming. Programming is needed in world security because there are situations where you will need to code. I feel comfortable with these tools, but I still need to get used to them.  I feel the lab is somehwta difficult because I hae to teach myself and go off what other students are doing from the slack. I know it would be easier if it was in person, but unfortunately that is not the case. I would like to learn more C or Java later on in the semester.

References:
I have used some of the students slack responses for some assistance and mainly Github.  Mariana, Alfredo, Ms.Mitra and Ms.Collazo have helped me on the lab. I have also used Dario's video that he posted.
